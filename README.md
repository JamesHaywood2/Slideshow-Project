# Slideshow-Project
Slideshow project for CS499 Senior Design  
By: James Haywood, Emma Fuller, and Jackie Newland.  

## Installation
Install Python 11, clone the repository, and install required Python libraries with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.  
Run Creator.py to create slideshows.  
Run Player.py to play the created slideshows.

Slide counter may be bugged. To fix please edit your ttkbootstrap installation ttkboostrap/widgets.py line 856 and change CUBIC to BICUBIC to get it to work.


## Uninstall
Either delete the executable or install folder. Additionally the program creates a folder in your local app data called PySlideshow where it stores cached images. Delete that as well.
