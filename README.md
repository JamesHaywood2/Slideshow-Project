# Slideshow-Project
Slideshow project for CS499 Senior Design  
Base by: James Haywood, Emma Fuller, and Jackie Newland.  
Capstone for James Haywood

## Capstone addition:
The capstone version differs from the original version by using a database to store all slideshow projects instead of a JSON file.

## Installation
To install download one of the three versions. If Windows Defender gets triggered and says it's a virus, either exclude it from windows defender or try a different version. If both fail download the raw code, Python 11, and the requirements.
### Directory:
Directory is the built executable, but it comes in a directory of necessary files.

### One File
One file is the entire program built into a single executable. This has a higher chance of triggering Windows Defender.

### Raw Code
Basically the contents of the code folder. If you want to install it this way make sure you have Python 11 and just do:  
```pip install requirements.txt```

## Uninstall
Either delete the executable or install folder. Additionally the program creates a folder in your local app data called PySlideshow where it stores cached images and the database. Delete that as well.
